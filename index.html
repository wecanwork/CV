								<small class="cv-background-section-item-byline">
									<time datetime="2013-06-01"> June 2013 </time> &mdash; Present
								</small>

								<p> Worked as a full stack web developer building and testing highly accessible, responsive and cross browser websites and widgets. My key responsibilities included: </p>

								<ul>

									<li> Working as part of an Agile team to maintain and expand the functionality of Channel 4's online services. </li>
									<li> Participating in collaborative estimation sessions for user stories and architectural changes </li>
									<li> Liaising with Business Analysts and project stakeholders </li>
									<li> Bug fixing, maintaining acceptance tests and providing general support to testers </li>
									<li> Participating in user experience design sessions and accessibility audits </li>

								</ul>

								<p> Some notable projects I worked on were: </p>

								<ul>

									<li>

										<h4> Global Navigation Service </h4>

										<p> An event driven widget written in HTML5, CSS3 &amp; JavaScript. Delivered as a service it provides all Channel 4 associated websites with the Channel 4 branding by injecting a header &amp; footer into the page that provides functionality such as consistent site navigation, brand search and user login. It also boasts a powerful event interface for developers to perform more advanced integration. </p>

										<p> As this had to have a small footprint, no external libraries could be used, so I had to create my own utilities for: JSONP requests, Cookie manipulation, Base64 encoding/decoding, iFrame communication, along with my own A+ compliant Promise and event bus implementation. </p>

									</li>

									<li>

										<h4> Font Delivery Service </h4>

										<p> A Node.js service that hosts and delivers the Channel 4 fonts to all of our web-based clients as securely as possible, replacing a 3rd party service called FontDeck, saving Channel 4 Â£15,000 a year. </p>

										<p> This application was also the first to be put through the continuous delivery pipeline, where I worked closely with operations to help define. </p>

									</li>

									<li>

										<h4> Chromecast </h4>

										<p> Liaised with Google to create the Chromecast sender application for the Channel 4 website. I was also a consultant during the development of the Chromecast Channel 4 receiver. </p>

									</li>

								</ul>

							</article>

							<p> Furthermore, during my time at Channel 4 I helped lead my team to migrate to Node.js and developed a test harness that made writing meaningful unit and integration tests easy and quick. </p>

									</li>

									<li>

										<h4> 4oD </h4>

										<p> I was put on the 4oD team to develop the front end of the the 2011 refresh of the 4oD website. </p>

									</li>

									<li>

										<h4> Single Sign On Concept </h4>

										<p> I was asked to build a single sign-on proof of concept using JavaScript, giving any site that loads a simple script the ability to access non sensitive user data and to allow user's to login into the site with their Channel 4 account. </p>
